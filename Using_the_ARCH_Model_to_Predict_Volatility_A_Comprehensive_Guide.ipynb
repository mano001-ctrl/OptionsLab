        "The Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) model, introduced by Robert Engle in 1982, is a key tool for modeling and forecasting time-varying volatility in financial time series. The ARCH model is widely used in risk management, portfolio optimization, and option pricing because financial markets exhibit heteroskedasticity—periods of high and low volatility clustering together.\n",

        "1. Understanding Volatility and Heteroskedasticity\n",
        "In financial markets, volatility refers to the degree of variation in asset prices over time. This variation is not constant; it changes depending on market conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the key characteristics of financial time series data is volatility clustering—high-volatility periods tend to follow other high-volatility periods, and low-volatility periods tend to follow other low-volatility periods. This violates the assumption of constant variance in traditional regression models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ARCH model explicitly accounts for this by modeling the conditional variance of a time series as a function of past squared errors.\n",

However, given its limitations, it is often extended to GARCH-family models for more realistic volatility modeling."

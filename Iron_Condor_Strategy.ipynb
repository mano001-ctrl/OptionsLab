    "# Risks of the Iron Condor Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Iron Condor** is a limited-risk, limited-reward options strategy, but it carries several risks:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Limited Profit\n",
    "- The maximum profit is the net credit received when opening the position.\n",
    "- For significant price moves beyond the range of short strikes, profits are reduced or eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Large Maximum Loss\n",
    "- Loss occurs when the price moves outside the range of the long strikes:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\text{Max Loss} = \\text{Difference Between Adjacent Strikes} - \\text{Net Credit Received}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Narrow Profit Range\n",
    "- Profits occur only if the stock price stays within the range of the short strikes.\n",
    "- Moderate market moves can lead to losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Volatility Risk\n",
    "- **Increasing Volatility** widens the price range for potential losses.\n",
    "- **Decreasing Volatility** benefits the position but may reduce its profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Liquidity and Execution Risk\n",
    "- Involves four legs, making execution costs high, especially with illiquid options.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Time Decay Risk\n",
    "- Benefits from time decay but can suffer losses if price moves early in the trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Early Assignment Risk\n",
    "- Short positions may be exercised early, especially in American-style options.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Market Gaps\n",
    "- Sudden overnight moves can cause significant losses beyond the expected range.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Risk Management Tips:\n",
    "- **Position Sizing**: Keep small to limit exposure.\n",
    "- **Adjustment Strategies**: Monitor and adjust positions actively.\n",
    "- **Volatility Assessment**: Enter during favorable volatility conditions.\n",
    "- **Liquidity Focus**: Use highly liquid options to reduce costs.\n",
    "- **Avoid Events**: Stay away from underlying assets with upcoming earnings or major news.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding these risks, traders can better manage the Iron Condor strategy in neutral market conditions.\n"
